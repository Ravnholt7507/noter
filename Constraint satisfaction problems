What is a constraint satisfaction problem?
    a constraint is a condition that must be met by a solution
    a constraint satisfaction problem is a problem in which a solution must satisfy a set of constraints
    constraints are found by describing the world(environment) in terms of variables and domains
    Example: schedule
        variables: time, room, instructor
        domains: time: 8:00-12:00, room: 1-10, instructor: 1-5
        constraints: time, room, instructor
    
    Example: map coloring
        variables: color
        domains: color: red, blue, green
        constraints: no two adjacent countries can have the same color
    
    unary constraints: a constraint that involves only one variable
    binary constraints: a constraint that involves two variables
    n-ary constraints: a constraint that involves n variables

consistency vs extensibility
    consistency: a solution must satisfy all constraints
    extensibility: a solution must satisfy all constraints, but it may be possible to add more constraints

what is naive backtracking:
    naive backtracking is a search algorithm that tries to find a solution by assigning values to variables one at a time
    it tries to assign a value to a variable and then tries to assign a value to the next variable
    if it cannot find a value that satisfies all constraints, it backtracks and tries a different value for the previous variable
    it continues to backtrack until it finds a solution or it runs out of values to try
    can be compared to a depth first search
